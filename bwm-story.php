    <p class="texts">Our path at BWM rests on a deep commitment to environmental sustainability and a vision of a
        society in which
        electronic waste is no longer a threat to our planet. BWM is not just a company. We are a movement, a force for
        change, and an agent for sustainability. Our dedicated ambition at BWM is to change the way electronic waste is
        seen and handled around the world. We envision a society where disposed electronic devices are not hazardous
        ticking time bombs, but rather precious materials that can be used to benefit our environment and future
        generations. Our goal is unwavering: to reduce the environmental effect of electronic waste through moral
        recycling. We are committed to reviving old gadgets for a new life.</p>

                <p class="texts">Our story at BWM is started with a strong sense of responsibility to environmental
                    conservation. It all began when our visionary founder set out on an attempt to revolutionize the way
                    electronic waste has been managed and recycled over the years. Our aim has been constant since the
                    beginning: to reduce the harmful effects caused by irresponsible dumping of electronic and other
                    hazardous waste through responsible and environment friendly methods of recycling. BWM wants to put
                    new life into discarded electronics, extend their usability through refurbishing; while promoting a
                    sustainable future.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="texts">Our early beginnings at BWM were defined by a strong desire, drive, and a vision to
                    lead the struggle against the environmental threat posed by many types of industrial waste. We knew
                    from the start that realizing our purpose into reality required not only unbreakable commitment, but
                    also substantial funds and investment. BWM's expanse grew in line as the need for responsible
                    management of electronic and other corporate waste increased. Within 5 years, we increased our reach
                    to Pan India services, covering the states of Maharashtra, Benglore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata,
                    Gujarat, and all the major states of the country. Our quick expansion is proof of the rising
                    awareness around the environmental impact of e-waste and IT waste and all the positive recycling
                    solutions BWM provides.

                <p class="texts">The rapid technological advancement comes with a hidden cost - a monumental surge in
                    corporate IT waste generated. As we started growing and taking up more and more clients for our
                    e-waste recycling services, the realization hit us! The current methods and machinery employed in
                    Indian markets for recycling are insufficient to handle this challenge. </p>
                <p class="texts">Hence, came the need of cutting-edge Recycling Factory. The impetus behind our new
                    factory was the realization that we need a more holistic solution, a facility designed not only to
                    tackle the colossal volume of electronic waste but also to optimize the recovery of valuable
                    resources contained within these discarded devices. </p>
                <p class="texts">Our state-of-the-art Electronic Waste Recycling Factory will stand as a testament to
