    <p class="texts">Recycling is the most important aspect of the Circular Economy that BWM has set out to achieve. In
        the normal economy, a certain enterprise or business produces a product, then it is consumed by the end user and
        at the end of that product's lifetime, it is discarded out of use. At BWM, we have decided to recycle the
        end-of-life product, or some parts of it thereof; making it reusable and keeping the economy flowing in a
        circular motion. Recycling of the materials in this way helps longer the lifetime of products, and also
        decreases pressure on the environment. If we continually keep disposing of the products, we need to keep
        sourcing raw materials from mother nature, harming our Earth in a very negative way. Reusing the materials not
        only reduces this unnecessary burden of extracting more and more raw materials but also helps lower greenhouse
        gas emissions during the production of newer sets of products. Thus, at BWM we believe that recyclability is the
        most important aspect of not only Circular Economy, but all of human life in general.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="texts">At BWM, we are responsibly exploring the pressing issue of rubber waste in India and
                    discussing innovative and sustainable solutions for its responsible recycling and management. Rubber
                    waste encompasses a wide range of materials, including scrap tires, industrial rubber products, and
                    rubber manufacturing waste. Improper disposal of rubber waste often leads to waste stockpiles, tire
                    dumps, or incineration, which can result in soil and water contamination, air pollution, and habitat
                    degradation. Responsible management and recycling of rubber waste are essential to mitigate these
                    challenges.</p>
